       Description

       Hw detected short circuit.

       If the short circuit protection detects a short circuit, the power stage will be shut down. This is done by Hw without Sw interaction.

       The Sw will restart the power stage within 500 microseconds. If no new short is detected within 100 ms this will be regarded as a glitch.

       If a new short circuit signal is detected within the 100 ms this will be regarded as a ""Hardware Detected Short Circuit"".

       Event state will be set back to pending when power stage is disabled. 

       A short circuit can be any of the following:

       Short circuit phase to phase

       Short circuit phase to ground (B-)

       Short circuit phase to Supply (B+)

       Description

       This is an inforamative event that in combination with the ShortCircuit-event can be usefull when analyzing short circuit situations.

       This event will be cleared when power stage is disabled. A consequnce of this is that for this event, unlike for the ShortCircuit-event, the occurance counter will increase also

       when trying to enable against a permanent short circuit.
